### Composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern and describes a group of objects that is treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to “compose” objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

- Now, the first example I want to show is the idea of grouping geometric shapes together.

- In a drawing application, we can drag around that and resize individual shapes, but also group several shapes together and then perform common operations on them. So what we're going to do is we're going to kind of emulate this scenario.
