### Repo and Folder structure

- Most demos & code examples are single-file.

- There is a dedicated folder for each pattern/principle and this folder contains 2 files. The file ending with **fixed** contains optimized code and other file contains the code before refactoring or when pattern was not applied.

- Each Folder contains a readme file which explains why & how the design pattern is applied to the existing code and what and how are the advantages gained after applying the principle to the existing code.
